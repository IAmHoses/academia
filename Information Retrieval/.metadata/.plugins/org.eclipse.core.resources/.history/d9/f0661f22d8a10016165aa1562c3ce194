REFACTORING LAST PROJECT:
	1. caseFolding as a part of prepping
	2. new regex for filenames:
		SO THAT THEY DON'T GET CONFUSED WITH ACRONYMS
	3. change in token extraction protocol:
		urls > emails > monetaries > ips > filenames
	4. potentially load filename extensions and extract them with that tool?
		Fixes pseudo-issue where stuff like foo.py is being extracted by URL recognizer
	5. new regex for acronyms
	6. changed prefixes finding condition from if to while
	7. changed numbers regex to include floating digit strings of length > 2 (1.2090420)
	8. added slashedWords to Normalization procress (i.e. food/drug --> fooddrug food drug)
